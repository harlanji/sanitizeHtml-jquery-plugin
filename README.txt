The jQuery sanitizeHtml plugin arose a simple desire to filter DOM without 
losing content or having to worry about regex being good enough. It simply 
traverses all children and sanitizes them recursively. This makes it a guarenteed 
safe replacement that nothing will slip through.

It is MIT licensed.

For more information see the documentation in jquery.sanitizeHtml.js.
